# Budget Tracker Starter Code

## Purpose

Your challenge this week is to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. 

## User Story

AS AN avid traveler <br>
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection <br>
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
